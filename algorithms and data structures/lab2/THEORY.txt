8)	The list below is partially ordered by insertion sort up until 5. How many comparisons and swaps are needed to sort the 5?
[1 3 4 8 9 5 2]
Answer:
Three comparisons, two swaps
According to insertion sort algorithm, the comparison and swapping are as follows:
1.	Compare 5 and 9, swap 5 and 9 as 5<9
New array: [1 3 4 8 5 9 2]
2.	Compare 5 and 8, swap 5 and 8 as 5<8
New array: [1 3 4 5 8 9 2]
3.	Compare 5 and 4, no swapping 5 and 8 as 5>4
New array: [1 3 4 5 8 9 2]


9)	The following array is the partial result of a sorting algorithm after the i'th iteration. 
[1   2   3   4   0  6  2  5  7  8  9] 
What could be the i and the algorithm (selection, insertion or shellsort)? 
Answer:
i=3, Insertion algorithm
Insertion algorithm format:
for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++)
   { 
     for (int j = i; j > 0 && less(a[j], a[j-1]); j--)
     exch(a, j, j-1);
   }

The first four elements of the array is sorted as the outer loop has iterated three times. Therefore i=3
As the iteration happens from left to right in insertion sort the first elements should be sorted before it reaches the end of the array
Thus by looking at the array above, it could be realized that insertion sort is used.

10)	Which method runs faster for each of the following items, selection sort or insertion sort?
Answer:
a) array with all keys identical 
Insertion sort is faster
Although the keys are identical, selection sort conducts N^2/2 comparisons
However, for insertion algorithm, the number of comparisons for this case is N-1
Therefore as selection sort is quadratic and insertion sort is linear, insertion sort could be considered as the fastest in this case

b) sorted array
Although the array is sorted, selection sort conducts N^2/2 comparisons
However, for insertion algorithm, the number of comparisons for the best case is N-1
Therefore as selection sort is quadratic and insertion sort is linear, insertion sort could be considered as the fastest in this case

c) array in reverse order
Selection algorithm is faster
The worst case of inserion algorithm is N^2/2 compares and N^2/2 exchanges
But selection algorithm uses N^2/2 compares and N exchanges to sort this array
As the number of exhnages is lesser for selection sort, it is the fastest 
 
      
11)	Consider the following partially sorted array by shell sort, for which h is it sorted? 
[10   25   20   35   30   45]
Answer:
In this shellsort it could be assumed that h is initialized as h=1.
Then, use N/3 for increment sequence and therefore the h = 3*1+1=4
Thus the 10 and 30 values are expected as sorted
According to the shell sort algorithm the next step is h=h/3
Hence new h=4/3 is approximately two
As the gap is two, following swaps are expected:
10 and 20
25 and 35
20 and 30
Then new h=2/3 which is approximately one
As the gap is one, following swap is expected:
10 and 25

Threfore the array is sorted for h=3, 2 and 1
